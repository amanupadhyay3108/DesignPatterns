Strategy Design Pattern â€“ Robot Example

This project demonstrates the Strategy Design Pattern using a simple robot system.
The Strategy Pattern allows defining a family of algorithms (or behaviors), encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable at runtime.
It helps achieve flexibility, reusability, and avoiding code duplication by using composition instead of inheritance.

ðŸ“Œ Problem

Imagine we are designing robots with different abilities:

Some robots can walk, others cannot.

Some can talk, others remain silent.

Some can fly, while others are grounded.

If we used inheritance only, we would end up with a large hierarchy of classes for every possible combination of abilities (e.g., WalkingTalkingRobot, FlyingSilentRobot, etc.).
This becomes rigid and hard to maintain.

âœ… Solution: Strategy Pattern

We separate behaviors (walk, talk, fly) into interfaces and their implementations.
Then, instead of hardcoding abilities inside robots, we inject behavior objects at runtime.

Walk behaviors: NormalWalk, NoWalk

Talk behaviors: NormalTalk, NoTalk

Fly behaviors: NormalFly, NoFly

Each robot (CompanionRobot, WorkerRobot, etc.) delegates its actions to these strategies.
